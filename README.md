##SQl
The project involves a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data, specifically focusing on COVID-19 deaths and vaccination rates. This analysis leverages SQL for data processing and transformation to create structured tables and dataframes. The resultant data is then visualized using Tableau to gain insights into the pandemic's impact and vaccination efforts.
